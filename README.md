YouTube a great digital platform as a means of marketing through uploading product or service videos. Using the YouTube data on popular You Tubers, we would like to know when it’s optimum to upload a video is it during the weekend or on a weekday so as to increase video viewership, brand awareness, social engagement and business development. We will also evaluate other factors that influence a video to trend on YouTube
